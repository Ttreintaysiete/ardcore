# Eurorack Ardcore 2017
This is the repository for the tuned sketches, schematics and board files of the 20Objects Ardcore. The Ardcore is an Arduino based eurorack module created by Darwin Grosse as his final work for MS. You can find more information on the orignal project in his website http://20objects.com/ardcore/.

So far there are a couple of versions of the ardcore, the original one by 20Objects which was a PCB only, AFAIK it was intended for dotcom and 5U formats and all the wiring with the panel has to be done manually. This version has 4 AnalogInputs, 2 of them are potentiometers and the other 2 are inputs. It also has 2 digital outputs (i.e. for triggers).
