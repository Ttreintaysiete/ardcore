# Eurorack Ardcore 2017
This is the repository for the tuned sketches, schematics and board files of the 20Objects Ardcore. The Ardcore is an Arduino based eurorack module created by Darwin Grosse as his final work for MS. You can find more information on the orignal project in his website http://20objects.com/ardcore/.

So far there are a couple of versions of the ardcore, the original one by 20Objects which was a PCB only, AFAIK it was intended for dotcom and 5U formats and all the wiring with the panel has to be done manually. This version has 4 AnalogInputs, 2 of them are potentiometers and the other 2 are inputs. It also has 2 digital outputs (i.e. for triggers).

The [original sketches](https://github.com/darwingrosse/ArdCore-Code/commits/master) were first published by Darwin back in 2012. This project originally was a DIY PCB only project.

Later on SnazzyFX published an eurorack format of the module and (as Dan a.k.a. told me) it was long out of stock due its success for a couple of years.

There are plenty of threads in muffwiggler talking about different DIY versions, back in 2013 we made our own version for bananas.
